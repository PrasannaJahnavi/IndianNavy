<h2>Helicopter</h2>
<p>
The naval variant is fitted with the Super Vision-2000 maritime radar, capable of detecting targets with low radar cross-section at a range of 200 km (120 mi). The anti-submarine version of the helicopter is fitted with dunking sonar, torpedoes, depth charges. The helicopter may also be fitted with the missiles for anti-ship roles. However, in 2008, the Indian Navy pronounced Dhruv unsuitable for its role as an ASW platform. Indian Navy will continue to procure Dhruv as a multi-role utility platform. During the commissioning ceremony Vice Admiral Sinha said that "In the Navy, Dhruv helicopters have transformed into an advanced search and rescue (SAR) helicopter also used for missions like heliborne operations, and armed patrol with night vision devices. Such machines in the inventory have become imperative for the Navy given the scenario of low-intensity maritime operations (LIMO) and coastal security construct."In 2013 Indian Navy showed keen interest in the armed version of the HAL Rudra. Impressed with the Dhruv's sensors which were able to track ships and also read their names at ranges of 12 to 14 km (7.5 to 8.7 mi). The Navy may induct 20 more helicopters into service.[48] A new squadron INAS 323 Harriers was commissioned with HAL Dhruv MKIII variant. Navy placed order for 16 MKIII helicopters and 6 of them are delivered with the remaining 10 to be delivered by Dec 2021. Naval variant of MKIII comes with 19 specific systems suited for maritime role.

<p>
Indian Navy to acquire the Soviet aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov.As reported by MiG Bureau, the Indian Navy's association with the MiG-29K began in Apr 2002 when a team led by Commander Gupta reached Moscow to evaluate the MiG-29K prototype for possible induction into the Indian Navy. The Team evaluated the aircraft on ground as well as in the air (the flight evaluation was conducted by a Navy Test Pilot Commander Ahuja). Some other aircraft were also evaluated but the MiG-29K was chosen. On 20 January 2004, the Indian Navy signed a contract for 12 single-seat MiG-29K and 4 two-seat MiG-29KUB. The first MIG-29K for the Indian Navy took flight on 22 January 2007. The MIG-29 KUB (two-seat trainer) is similar to the MIG-29K but with reduced operational range. The aircraft will be fielded on the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya.

New Delhi and Boeing signed a $2.1 billion contract in January 2009 to deliver eight P-8Is for anti-submarine operations, to replace the fleet of Russian-manufactured Tupolev Tu142M planes. The P-8I varies from the P-8A, with the Magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) has been kept intact while an aft-mounted radar provides 360-degree aerial radar surveillance capability.[36] Many of the communication and other devices on-board are developed by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL).The first squadron, INAS 312, was formed with eight aircraft in November 2015.A follow-on order worth over $1 billion for the purchase of four additional P-8Is was signed in July 2016.The Indian Navy decommissioned the Tupolev Tu-142M aircraft in March 2017.With Boeing delivering the 12th and the final P-8I in February 2022,the second squadron, INAS 316, with four aircraft was formed in March 2022.
