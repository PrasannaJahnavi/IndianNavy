The Navy has two aircraft carriers in active service, INS Vikramaditya, which serves as the flagship of the fleet. Vikramaditya (formerly Admiral Gorshkov) is a modified Kiev-class aircraft carrier procured at a total cost $2.3 billion from Russia in December 2013. A second aircraft carrier, the indigenously built INS Vikrant was commissioned on September 2, 2022.The Navy has an amphibious transport dock of the Austin class, renamed as INS Jalashwa in Indian service.

The navy currently operates two Visakhapatnam, three Kolkata, three Delhi and three Rajput-class guided-missile destroyers.The ships of the Rajput class are being replaced by the next-generation Visakhapatnam-class destroyers (Project 15B) which feature a number of improvements.
In addition to destroyers, the navy operates several classes of frigates such as three Shivalik (Project 17 class) and six Talwar-class frigates.Seven additional modified Shivalik-class frigates (Project 17A class frigates) are on order, all of which are under various stages of construction. Smaller littoral zone combatants in service are in the form of corvettes, of which the Indian Navy operates the Kamorta, Kora, Khukri, Veer and Abhay-class corvettes. Replenishment tankers such as the Jyoti-class tanker, INS Aditya and the new Deepak-class fleet tanker help improve the navy's endurance at sea.

Since playing a decisive role in the victory, the navy has been a deterrent force maintaining peace for India in a region of turmoil. In 1983, the Indian Navy planned for Operation Lal Dora to support the government of Mauritius against a feared coup. In 1986, in Operation Flowers are Blooming, the Indian Navy averted an attempted coup in the Seychelles.In 1988, India launched Operation Cactus, to successfully thwart a coup d'Ã©tat by PLOTE in the Maldives. Naval maritime reconnaissance aircraft detected the ship hijacked by PLOTE rebels. INS Godavari and Indian marine commandos recaptured the ship and arrested the rebels.During the 1999 Kargil War, the Western and Eastern fleets were deployed in the Northern Arabian Sea, as a part of Operation Talwar.They safeguarded India's maritime assets from a potential Pakistani naval attack, as also deterred Pakistan from attempting to block India's sea-trade routes.[citation needed] The Indian Navy's aviators flew sorties and marine commandos fought alongside Indian Army personnel in the Himalayas.
